<h1>The assignment</h1>

Here is the asignment from the course leader:

<h2>Project Specification</h2>

Duration: 2-3 days

<h3>Task 1 : Mandatory</h3>

Create a simple web app for our customers that displays a list of orders (or parcels) with some details they need to know like order status, ETAs, pickup locations, etc. Feel free to have UI/UX that best fits the use-case.

API Endpoint: https://my.api.mockaroo.com/orders.json?key=e49e6840

The app MUST be done using ReactJS and support major mobile & desktop browsers/layouts.

<h3>Task 2 : Optional</h3>

Briefly describe ( or implement partially ) how can this solution be scaled to support multiple countries and languages?

<h4>Important notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Your project MUST have a README file with clear instructions on project setup and how to run/deploy the app
<li>README file can also include design considerations and list dependencies
<li>Outline testing strategy and approach
<li>Keep the project very simple (yet professional)
<li>You shouldnâ€™t spend more than 4-5 hours on this exercise
</ul>

<h4>Constraints</h4>

<ul>
<li>Use the latest public stable versions of libraries, frameworks or tools
<li>Host your project on GitHub or other cloud-based repositories
</ul>

When you complete this exercise, send your solution repository link to HR.

<h1>Dependencies</h1>

This project is dependent on:
<ul>
<li>React
<li>all the files in the 'src' directory
<ul>
<li>components
<ul>
<li>Header.js
<li>MainMenu.js
<li>MainContent.js
<li>Footer.js
</ul>
<li>App.js
<li>App.css
</ul>
<li>This URL: https://my.api.mockaroo.com/orders.json?key=e49e6840
</ul>



<h1>Project setup</h1>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
